Legion provides robust support for debugging applications. The tools
below fall into two categories: those intended for debugging
applications, and those for debugging the runtime itself.

Generally speaking, users should start by trying these tools
(typically in this order):

 * [Debug Mode](#debug-mode) (`DEBUG=1 make; ./app`)
 * [Backtrace](#backtrace) (`LEGION_BACKTRACE=1 ./app`)
 * [Freeze On Error](#freeze-on-error) (`LEGION_FREEZE_ON_ERROR=1 ./app`)
 * [Privilege Checks](#privilege-checks) (`CC_FLAGS=-DPRIVILEGE_CHECKS make; ./app`)
 * [Bounds Checks](#bounds-checks) (`CC_FLAGS=-DBOUNDS_CHECKS make; ./app`)
 * [Partition Checks](#partition-checks) (`./app -lg:partcheck`)
 * [Legion Spy](#legion-spy) (`./app -lg:spy -logfile spy_%.log; ./tools/legion_spy.py -dez spy_*.log`)

The following tools are typically used after the initial debugging
tools have been exhausted or in special circumstances:

 * [Logging Infrastructure](#logging-infrastructure)
 * [Debug Tasks](#debug-tasks)
 * [Delay Start](#delay-start) (`./app -lg:delay N` where `N` is in seconds)
 * [In-Order Execution](#in-order-execution) (`./app -lg:inorder`)
 * [Full-Size Instances](#full-size-instances)
 * [Separate Runtime Instances](#separate-runtime-instances) (`./app -lg:separate -ll:util 0`)
 * [Dump Backtraces](#dump-backtraces) (`./app -ll:force_kthreads`)
 * [Dump Events](#dump-events)
 * [Trace Memory Allocations](#trace-memory-allocations) (`CC_FLAGS=-DTRACE_ALLOCATION make; ./app -level allocation=2`)
 * [Legion GC](#legion-gc) (`CC_FLAGS=-DLEGION_GC make; ./app -level legion_gc=2 -logfile gc_%.log; ./tools/legion_gc.py -l gc_*.log`)

## Try These First

### Debug Mode

For any Legion application that is not exhibiting expected
behavior, the first debugging technique should always be
to compile Legion in debug mode. If the
application is being built using our standard Makefile
infrastructure, this is done simply by setting `DEBUG=1` in the environment or
at the top of the application's Makefile. Compiling the
runtime in debug mode will enable many checks which are
disabled in release mode and may uncover both application
as well as runtime bugs.

A quick note on error messages: we endeavor to provide useful error
messages, but Legion is still an experimental system and there may be
assertions that do not produce useful error messages. If you encounter
one of these assertions (regardless of whether it is an application or
runtime bug), please report it on the [bug tracker](/community/).

### Backtrace

Legion can automatically print a backtrace when an error occurs (such
as an assertion failure or a segfault). This capability has a
negligible performance impact and is therefore recommended in settings
where crashes occur in production applications. Backtraces often
provide initial clues as to where a bug may be hiding, and can direct
further debugging efforts. To enable backtraces, set
`LEGION_BACKTRACE` to `1` in the environment:

{% highlight bash %}
LEGION_BACKTRACE=1 ./app
{% endhighlight %}

When using `mpirun` as a launcher for the application, remember that a
`-x` flag is required to pass the variable to the child process:

{% highlight bash %}
mpirun -x LEGION_BACKTRACE=1 ./app
{% endhighlight %}

(Note: `LEGION_BACKTRACE` can also be spelled `REALM_BACKTRACE`. Both
spellings are identical.)

### Freeze On Error

Legion has the ability to freeze the application if it reaches an
error (such as an assertion failure or a segfault). This capability is
particularly useful in multi-node runs and in situations where the bug
might reproduce sporadically. To enable this, set
`LEGION_FREEZE_ON_ERROR` to `1` in the environment:

{% highlight bash %}
LEGION_FREEZE_ON_ERROR=1 ./app
{% endhighlight %}

When using `mpirun` as a launcher for the application, remember that a
`-x` flag is required to pass the variable to the child process:

{% highlight bash %}
mpirun -x LEGION_FREEZE_ON_ERROR=1 ./app
{% endhighlight %}

(Note: `LEGION_FREEZE_ON_ERROR` can also be spelled
`REALM_FREEZE_ON_ERROR`. Both spellings are identical.)

If the application crashes, it will freeze with an message such as the
following. After logging in to the node, it should then be possible to
attach to the process with a debugger. For example:

{% highlight text %}
Process 12345 on node n0123 is frozen!

$ # logged in to n0123
$ gdb -p 12345
...

{% endhighlight %}

(As a hint, the offending thread is usually running `nanosleep`. Many
of the other threads are message handers and such and are not useful
for debugging purposes.)

{% endhighlight %}

### Privilege Checks

While Legion does have a [type system](/publications/)
capable of statically verifying that all region accesses
abide by the stated privileges requested by a task, these
guarantees are only available for applications written in
Regent. For applications written in C++ that use the Legion runtime
interface directly, we provide a way of dynamically verifying
privileges on all memory accesses.

To enable privilege checks, the `-DPRIVILEGE_CHECKS` flag
should be added to the list of compile time flags specified
by the `CC_FLAGS` environment variable in Legion application
Makefile. This will enforce a privilege check for every
memory access done through a region accessor. If any privileges
violate the originally requested privileges for the task,
then a runtime error will be raised. Since this check is
performed on every memory access, it can significantly
degrade performance, but is very useful at finding privilege
violations that would traditionally be caught by the
Legion type system.

### Bounds Checks

In addition to checking the privileges on all memory
accesses, we also provide a mechanism for verifying that
all memory accesses fall within the bounds of the logical
regions requested by a task. This feature is also used
to catch application bugs which would normally be caught
at compile-time by the Legion type system, but which may
escape detection when writing programs directly to the
runtime API. To enable these checks, the `-DBOUNDS_CHECKS`
flag should the added to the list of compile time flags
specified by the `CC_FLAGS` environment variable in a
Legion application Makefile. We again note that because
these checks are performed on every memory access, they
can significantly degrade the performance of a Legion
application.

### Partition Checks

One of the more commonly occurring bugs in Legion applications
is creating partitions which an application declares to
be disjoint, but for which the provided coloring is not
actually disjoint. For performance reasons, when a call
to `create_index_partition` is made, Legion does *NOT*
check the declared disjointness of the coloring. Instead
the runtime simply trusts the applications to correctly
specify the disjointness of the partition. As users have
experimented with more complicated coloring schemes, we've
noticed an increasing number of cases where colorings are
claimed to be disjoint when they actually are not.

To address this problem, we provide the `-lg:partcheck`
command line flag which instructs the Legion high-level
runtime to verify the disjointness of all colorings which
are claimed to be disjoint and report a runtime error if
they are not. Depending on the size and type of coloring
as well as the number of colors, these checks can take
arbitrarily long and may degrade performance. Due to the
extreme performance cost associated with these checks, the
`-lg:partcheck` flag will issue a warning if it is used in conjuction
with profiling.

### Legion Spy

Legion Spy is a visualization tool for task dependencies. This is
useful for two reasons. First, visualizing dependendencies can help as
a sanity check to confirm that Legion is recording the set of tasks
and dependencies that the user expects. Second, Legion Spy contains a
second implementation of the Legion dependence analysis algorithms,
which it can cross-check against the captured dependencies to verify
the runtime itself.

These modes have slightly different usage patterns, as a full check of
the runtime analysis is relatively expensive.

To use visualize dependencies, run the application with `-lg:spy
-logfile spy_%.log`. (No special compile-time flags are necessary.)
This will produce one log file per node. Then run the post-processing
script `legion_spy.py` on the log files to generate PDF files of the
various visualizations in the current directory.

{% highlight bash %}
./app -lg:spy -logfile spy_%.log
$LG_RT_DIR/tools/legion_spy.py -dez spy_*.log
{% endhighlight %}

(The options used here are `-d` for dataflow graph, `-e` for event
graph, and `-z` to include more information, such as field names.)

To use Legion Spy's full checking mode, compile with
`CC_FLAGS=-DLEGION_SPY` in the environment or at the top of the
application Makefile. Run the application as before, and call the
script with `-lpa` (`-l` for logical analysis, `-p` for physical, and
`-a` to assert on failure). (The options `-dez` will work as well.)

{% highlight bash %}
CC_FLAGS=-DLEGION_SPY make
./app -logfile spy_%.log
$LG_RT_DIR/tools/legion_spy.py -lpa spy_*.log
$LG_RT_DIR/tools/legion_spy.py -dez spy_*.log
{% endhighlight %}

The graph below is an example of the output generated by
Legion Spy. Boxes correspond to different kinds of operations while
edges represent explicit event dependences between the different
operations.

## Other Debugging Options

### Logging Infrastructure

Legion has a sophisticated logging infrastructure with support for
logging levels and categorization of messages. Logging is done using
static singleton objects called *loggers*. Each category of message is
declared as a static singleton object. For example, near the top of
the default mapper implementation in `default_mapper.cc` we create the
following logger category:

{% highlight cpp %}
Logger::Category log_mapper("default_mapper");
{% endhighlight %}

Loggers can be used in either printf style or C++ ostream style. The
exact invocation depends on the desired logging level. For example:

{% highlight cpp %}
// printf-style
log_mapper.warning("hello printf %e\n", 3.14);
// C++ ostream style
log_mapper.debug() << "hello ostream" << 3.14; // no endl
{% endhighlight %}

Legion supports six levels of logging (in order from lowest priority
to highest): `spew`, `debug`, `info`, `print`, `warning`, and `error`.

Message filtering of different levels is controlled simultaneously by
a static and a dynamic switch.  First, the Makefile variable
`OUTPUT_LEVEL` places a static lower bound on which messages can be
emitted. Any messages below this level are guaranteed to be statically
elided by the compiler to avoid any runtime overhead. The logging
level can also be controlled dynamically by a command line
argument. Passing the `-level [<category>=]<int>` flag on the command
line will dynamically set the minimum (inclusive) logging level for
the specified category (or if omitted, all categories), with 0
corresponding to `spew` and 5 corresponding to `error`.

By default, logging messages are emitted to `stderr`. Often it is
desirable to log output to a file (or a file per node) instead. The
`-logfile` flag can be used to specify a filename for the logs. A `%`
character in the name (if any) will be replaced by the node number
(resulting in one log file per node).

For example, the command line below sets a logging level of 4 for
`tasks`, 2 for `legion_spy`, and 3 for everything else, and directs
output to a series of files `prof_0.log`, `prof_1.log`, etc. for each
node.

{% highlight bash %}
./app -level tasks=4,legion_spy=2,3 -logfile prof_%.log
{% endhighlight %}

### Debug Tasks

One very useful debugging technique that we have
found has been the ability to use *debug tasks*
as a means of introspecting Legion applications.
Due to the out-of-order nature of Legion task
execution, using a traditional debugger like `gdb`
to debug a single-node Legion application can be
challenging. To aid in setting break-points and
checking conditions in association with a debugger
we commonly inject explicit debug tasks which are
either empty tasks or tasks which do not impact
correctness and simply check for certain conditions
regarding the data in logical regions. One example of
a kind of debugging task can be seen in our
[full circuit simulation](tutorial/circuit.html)
example which has optional checking tasks for
verifying that there are no `NaN` or `Inf` values
in our simulation.

Debug tasks are a very useful tool as they can request
their own privileges and logical regions for introspecting
all or a subset of an applications data.  Similarly by
changing privileges and coherence modes, debug tasks
can control where they are run in the order of execution
of tasks. We routinely launch debug tasks which declare
stronger privileges than necessary (e.g. `READ-WRITE`
instead of `READ-ONLY`) in order to prevent any later
tasks from running in parallel.

In practice, the ability to launch debug tasks is one of
the most useful features of Legion, enabling introspection
that can be easily enabled and disabled without worrying
about correctness. Really, debug tasks are just a very
primitive form of `in-situ` analytics.

### Delay Start

In some cases it can be useful to attach a debugger to a program prior
to the point where it actually fails. This can be challenging
particularly in multi-node executions where the user cannot simply run
`gdb --args ./app ...`. To assist in such cases, Legion provides an
option to pause at the beginning of an application run. The user can
then use the delay to manually attach to the process with a debugger.

The following command will cause Legion to pause for 30 seconds prior
to starting the top-level task:

{% highlight bash %}
./app -lg:delay 30
{% endhighlight %}

The user can use this opportunity to find the appropriate PID and
attach with a debugger. For example, assuming that `ps` reports that
the PID is `12345`:

{% highlight bash %}
ps -u $(whoami)
gdb -p 12345
{% endhighlight %}

After entering the debugger, the user can set breakpoints or configure
settings as appropriate, and then when ready can issue the command
`continue` to resume execution of the application.

### In-Order Execution

While the goal of the Legion runtime is to implicitly
discover parallelism between tasks and other operations,
in many cases, when debugging a Legion application, it is
useful to know that operations are actually executed
in the order in which they are issued. This can be useful
both for debugging Legion application code, as well as
for investigating runtime bugs. To enable this feature,
execute the application with the command-line flag `-lg:inorder`.
When running
in this mode sub-tasks and other operations launched
within a parent task will be issued and run to completion
before the next operation is issued. This guarantees
that all operations are performed in program
order with no parallelism being extracted.

### Full-Size Instances

Another useful debugging tool available is the ability
to create <em>full-size</em> physical
instances. In many cases, the Legion runtime only
allocates space for the data requested by a task based
on its logical region usage. If the requested logical
regions are not the top-level logical regions in the
region tree, the Legion runtime will trim the physical
instances to only store the necessary data.

In the past, trimming physical instances has resulted
in two kinds of bugs. First, applications which do
not access data within the their logical region bounds
(e.g. those that fail bounds checks), have caused
random memory corruption by reading and writing in
locations not actually intended. Second, trimming has
in the past been a source of runtime bugs as it is
difficult to ensure all the Legion copy routines
properly recognized trimmed physical instances.

To help discover both types of bugs, the Legion
runtime can be compiled with the `-DFULL_SIZE_INSTANCES`
compile-time flag set in the `CC_FLAGS` of a
Legion application Makefile. This feature forces the
Legion runtime to always allocated physical instances
of the size of the top-level logical region in the
region tree. This prevents out-of-bounds memory accesses
from corrupting other instances and can aid in finding
runtime errors. If an application runs correctly
with `-DFULL_SIZE_INSTANCES` and passes all bounds
checks then it is likely a runtime bug and should
be reported on the
[bug tracker](/discussion/).

### Separate Runtime Instances

When debugging messaging protocols within the
Legion runtime, it can be challenging to
attach debuggers to processes on different
nodes. To make debugging these protocols simpler,
Legion supports a modified execution setup.
By default, there is only ever a single Legion
runtime instance per process (and by default
per node since we usually only launch a single
Legion process on each node). To support debugging
these messaging protocols on a single node, we
provide an execution setup where an instance
of the Legion runtime is created for each
individual processor in the machine. This
creates multiple instances of the Legion runtime
within a single process. Under this setting
messages are then used to communicate between
the different runtime instances (just as they
would be in the truly distributed case). This
allows a single debugger to be attached
to a process on a single node and observe
the different runtime instances. This setting
can be enabled by passing the flags `-lg:separate -ll:util 0`
on the command line. (The `-ll:util 0` is required because this mode
does not support execution with explicit utility processors.)

### Dump Backtraces

When debugging a freeze in Legion, the first step should always be to
dump backtraces on all nodes. This will help determine (a) if the
application is truly frozen or simply executing slowly, and (b)
whether there are any obvious or unusual functions on the stack traces
that may point to a possible cause.

One complicating factor is that Legion employs user-level threads by
default. Therefore, in order to get useful backtraces, it is necessary
to use the flag `-ll:force_kthreads` to disable user-level threads:

{% highlight bash %}
./app -ll:force_kthreads
# wait for the application to freeze
gdb -p 12345
apply thread all bt # inside gdb, dump backtraces
{% endhighlight %}

Note also that it is important to compile with debug symbols or else
line numbers will not appear in the resulting backtraces. This can be
accomplished by running in [debug mode](#debug-mode) (which is
recommended anyway), or if the freeze does not reproduce in debug
mode, Legion can be compiled with `-Og -ggdb` or similar to ensure
that debug symbols are available.

### Dump Events

When debugging a freeze, if dumping backtraces fails to provide
insight, then it can be helpful to dump the Realm event graph to
determine if a cycle has formed. Note in order for this to work,
Legion *must* be compiled with debug symbols (`-Og -ggdb` or
similar). [Debug mode](#debug-mode) is not required.

To dump the events, run the application and wait for it to
freeze. Then attach with a debugger and call the function
`Realm::realm_show_events(0)`. The environment variable
`REALM_SHOW_EVENT_FILENAME` controls where the resulting log files are
stored.

Using gdb, this might look like:

{% highlight bash %}
export REALM_SHOW_EVENT_FILENAME=$PWD/events.txt
./app
# wait for the application to freeze
gdb -p 12345
call Realm::realm_show_events(0)
{% endhighlight %}

This should result in a file called `events.txt`. This file can be
processed by a Legion tool called `detect_loops` to look for cycles in
the event graph:

{% highlight bash %}
make -C legion/tools detect_loops
legion/tools/detect_loops event.txt
{% endhighlight %}

If a cycle is found it will be displayed on stdout.

### Trace Memory Allocations

This is a tool for checking the number of internal Legion objects
allocated over time, and their total memory usage.

{% highlight bash %}
CC_FLAGS=-DTRACE_ALLOCATION make
./app -level allocation=2
{% endhighlight %}

Legion will periodically print the total number of internal Legion
objects that have been allocated, their total memory usage, and the
difference (in number and size) compared to the last snapshot.

### Legion GC

This is a tool for checking for application leaks of Legion API
objects or handles.

{% highlight bash %}
CC_FLAGS=-DLEGION_GC make
./app -level legion_gc=2 -logfile gc_%.log
./tools/legion_gc.py -l gc_*.log
{% endhighlight %}

This tool will print a message if any objects are leaked by the
application.
