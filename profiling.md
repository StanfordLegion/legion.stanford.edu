title: Performance Profiling and Tuning
---

After developing a functional Legion application, it is usually
necessary to profile and tune for performance. This page covers
techniques to achieving high performance in Legion applications.

  * [Preliminary Steps](#preliminary-steps)
  * [Legion Prof](#legion-prof)
  * [General Optimization Techniques](#general-optimization-techniques)
  * Legion Configuration:
      * [Machine Configuration](#machine-configuration)
      * [Legion Runtime Performance Flags](#legion-runtime-performance-flags)

## Preliminary Steps

When performance is desired, *always* build Legion in release mode
(i.e. `DEBUG=0 make`). Release mode ensures that expensive assertions
and checks are disabled, and that appropriate optimization flags are
used in the build. Also, remember to remove any unnecessary build
flags (e.g. `-DPRIVILEGE_CHECKS`, `-DBOUNDS_CHECKS`, or
`-DLEGION_SPY`).

Set `OUTPUT_LEVEL` at an appropriate level. The default
(`LEVEL_DEBUG`) is usually acceptable as dynamic checks are sufficient
to ensure that the extra logging statements are not a performance
problem. However, a higher level such as `LEVEL_SPEW` might cause
problems, even when disabled on the command-line.

If using GASNet, ensure that [GASNet has been properly configured and
optimized](/gasnet/). GASNet can be important for performance on
multi-node runs.

## Legion Prof

Before taking steps towards optimizing a program, it is usually
helpful to profile the application in question. Legion has a
task-level profiler called Legion Prof which is used for this purpose.

Legion Prof is compiled into all builds by default, so no additional
compile-time flags are required. However, it is always recommended to
compile Legion in release mode (i.e. `DEBUG=0`) before measuring
performance.

To profile an application, run with `-hl:prof <N>` where `N` is the
number of nodes to be profiled. (`N` can be less than the total number
of nodes---this profiles a subset of the nodes.) Use the `-logfile`
flag to save the output from each node to a separate file (see
[logging documentation](/debugging/#logging-infrastructure)).
Finally, pass the resulting log files to `legion_prof.py`.

{% highlight bash %}
DEBUG=0 make
./app -hl:prof <N> -logfile prof_%.log
$LG_RT_DIR/tools/legion_prof.py prof_*.log
{% endhighlight %}

This will generate a subdirectory called `legion_prof` under the
current directory, including a file named `index.html`. Open this file
in your browser.

The web pages generated by Legion Prof are interactive. To zoom in,
click and drag the mouse over a region of interest. For other options,
use the `?` to show a help message.

A sample of Legion Prof's output is shown below.

## General Optimization Techniques

In general there are three primary factors that contribute
to the performance of a Legion application.

 1. Overall task and data movement throughput
 2. Latency of the critical path through the task/copy graph
 3. Runtime overhead

There are many variables which can impact each of these
three performance metrics including the decisions made by the
application mapper(s), the size and shape of the 
region trees, the selected regions and fields requested
by tasks, and the settings of many of the variables
specified on this page. The goal of performance profiling
is to determine which variables are impacting performance
and tune them for the best performance. Due to the large
parameter spaces in Legion programs this is a difficult
problem to solve in general. We therefore give some basic
suggestions that we use when tuning Legion applications.

When tuning our Legion applications we usually make heavy
use of Legion Prof to understand the costs of our mapping
decisions and the performance of the runtime. A normal tuning
cycle involves profiling the execution of our application,
investing Legion Prof output to determine the most pressing
bottlenecks, and then modifying the necessary parameters
or Mapper implementations. Legion Prof time lines are the
most common output that we investigate as they can show
which processors are under-utilized as well as when there
are bubbles in task execution. While this is useful, it
doesn't always suggest why there are bubbles. Legion Prof
does not show data movement operations and therefore bubbles
can be caused either by critical path dependences, or by
pending data movement operations. We currently rely on
application specific information to discern the cause.

While the performance of the application is usually the
limiter, it is also possible for runtime overhead to be a 
performance limiter. This most commonly manifests by seeing
bubbles in processor executions. The real indicator
is evident when looking at the runtime meta-tasks being
run on the utility processors. If the runtime is not
running sufficiently far ahead of the actual execution of
the program, the IDs of the tasks being mapped will be
in close proximity to the tasks being executed. If the 
runtime is running efficiently it will often be 10s to 100s
of IDs in front of the actual execution.

Performance debugging, even in Legion, is still very much
an art form and we are open to suggestions as to ways to
improve it. We are open to suggestions about new tools
to build to help with Legion debugging and are willing
to place the appropriate logging calls in the Legion 
runtime, especially if users are interested in helping
to write the post-processing and visualization tools. If 
you have suggestions, please post them to the 
[mailing list](/community/).

## Legion Configuration

Legion has a large number of flags that impact performance. These can
be divided into two categories:

 1. Flags to configure the machine (number of CPUs, GPUs, memory sizes, etc.)
 2. Flags to configure internal runtime parameters (scheduling windows, etc.)

### Machine Configuration

Legion provides a multitude of command line parameters which can be
used to specify the machine configuration that is made visible to an
application and its mapper through the `Machine` object. All these
flags are interpreted by the Realm low-level runtime and are therefore
prefixed with `-ll:`.

 * `-ll:cpu <int>` - Specify the number of latency optimized
    `Processors` to allocate on each node. Typically this
    should be one or two less than the number of physical CPU cores 
    available on a node. The default is 1.
 * `-ll:util <int>` - Specify the number of utility `Processors`
    to allocate on each node. Utility processors are used
    for performing runtime meta-tasks such as dependence analysis
    and mapping. More utility processors help reduce runtime
    overhead at the cost of consuming more hardware cores for 
    meta-work. The default is 1.
 * `-ll:gpu <int>` - Specify the number of 
    GPUs on each node. This should be less than or equal to the number of discrete GPUs on
    the node. The default is 0.
 * `-ll:amsg <int>` - Set the number of 
    threads used for handling active message traffic
    between nodes. There must always
    be at least one of these threads. Applications which are 
    very communication intensive may consider increasing the 
    number of threads for handling active messages. The default
    value is 1.
 * `-ll:dma <int>` - Specify the number of 
    threads used for handling copies. For applications
    which do significant movement of data between distinct 
    memories, increasing the number of DMA threads can significantly
    improve performance. There must always be at least one DMA
    thread. The default value is 1.
 * `-ll:csize <int>` - Set the amount of system memory per node
    available to the CPUs (e.g. DRAM) in MBs. In general this value
    should be less than the maximum amount of physical memory available
    on a node. If it is set larger, applications may end up thrashing
    virtual DRAM pages. The default is 512 MB.
 * `-ll:gsize <int>` - Specify the amount of memory
    that should be allocated to the GASNet global memory in MB. The GASNet
    memory provides a globally visible memory
    across all nodes. This means that all nodes can
    read and write the GASNet memory but at the extreme cost of 
    doing explicit RDMA reads and writes. The amount of GASNet
    memory divided by the total number of nodes must be less than
    or equal to the GASNet segment size (e.g. set by the
    environment variable `GASNET_PHYSMEM_MAX`). The default value 
    is 256 MB.
 * `-ll:rsize <int>` - Set the amount of GASNet registered
    memory in MB to be allocated on each node. Registered memory
    is pinned memory that is registered with GASNet so that it
    may used for doing one-sided RDMA operations. It is therefore
    especially useful for placing physical instances which are
    often communicated in these memories (e.g. ghost region 
    instances). The maximum amount of registered memory must be
    less than GASNet segment size (controlled by the
    `GASNET_PHYSMEM_MAX` environment variable). The default value is 0.
 * `-ll:fsize <int>` - Indicate the amount of memory
     in MB to be allocated for GPU's framebuffer memory. This value
     is required to be less than the total amount of physical GDDR5
     memory available in each GPU. The default is 256 MB.
 * `-ll:zsize <int>` - Indicate the amount of zero-copy
     memory in MB to allocate on each node. Zero-copy memory is 
     memory that is mapped into each GPUs address space as well as
     to CPU-side DRAM and is therefore accessible by all the CPUs and
     GPUs on the same node. However, it is very slow for GPUs to
     access because reads and writes must traverse the PCI-E bus.
     For more information on zero-copy memory we refer users
     [here](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/#zero-copy).
     The default value is 64 MB.
 * `-ll:stacksize <int>` - Indicate the maximum stack size to allocate
     for each CPU thread in MB. By default the values is 2 MB
     (consistent with the Posix nominal value).
 * `-ll:sdpsize <int>` - Set the maximum amount of 
     pinned memory available for sending GASNet active messages on 
     a node. Users should really only need to increase this value 
     if they observe failures of the `set_payload` runtime method. 
     The default is 64 MB.
 * `-ll:lmbsize <int>` - Indicate the maximum size 
     of active messages that can be sent between a pair of nodes 
     by fixing an upper bound on long message buffer (LMB) sizes 
     in MB. Larger messages will get broken into chunks of at most 
     this size. The default is 1 MB.
 * `-ll:numlmbs <int>` - Set the maximum number
     of long message buffers that should be created between a
     pair of nodes. More buffers will increase the number of
     large active messages that can be in flight simultaneously,
     but at the cost of increasing pinned registered memory
     usage in the GASNet segment. The default is 2.
 * `-ll:pin <int>` - Specify whether the 
     CPU system memory allocated by the `-ll:csize` flag should
     be pinned. Pinning the memory means that copies to and from
     the GPU can make use of the asynchronous DMA engines on the
     GPU. Note that pinning doesn't register this memory with
     GASNet which distinguishes this memory from registered memory.
     The default value is 1 indicating true.

### Legion Runtime Performance Flags

The Legion runtime itself also provides command-line flags for
controlling the execution of its out-of-order task processor. Not
surprisingly many of these flags are related to parameters which
are tuned by hardware architects in out-of-order processors. Since
Legion is built in software though, users have the direct ability
to tune these parameters to their particular application. In keeping
with the naming scheme used above, all high-level runtime flags
are prefixed by `-hl:`.

 * `-hl:window` - Specify the maximum number of operations that 
    can be outstanding in a given task context (e.g. how many
    sub-tasks and operations can a task issue) before the 
    task is stalled. This upper bound provides one way of 
    applying back pressure on long running tasks and prevent
    them from running too far in advance. In many ways this
    value is analogous to the size of a re-order buffer (ROB)
    in hardware processors.  The default value is 1024.
 * `-hl:sched` - Set the maximum number of ready tasks which
    must be available to run on a low-level processor before
    the high-level runtime stops invoking the mapper to 
    schedule more tasks. This controls how far in advance
    tasks are scheduled onto a processor. Note by Little's
    Law, more tasks must be mapped to a processor if the
    tasks require longer to map. In many ways this value is
    analogous to the number of entries available at reservation 
    stations for hardware resource units. The default value is 1.
 * `-hl:width` - Indicate the number of operations which the
    high-level runtime should consider when making a scheduling
    pass. The wider this is, the more operations will be touched
    in a scheduling pass.  This can increase throughput, but also
    increase latency of scheduling on processors. This value
    is analogous to the super-scalar width of modern processors.
    The default value is 4.
 * `-hl:message` - Specify the maximum size of messages in bytes that
    can be sent between two instances of the high-level runtime.
    Smaller message sizes can decrease the latency of communication
    by pipelining communication, but can achieve lower interconnect
    bandwidth. Larger messages can achieve higher bandwidth, but
    at the cost of higher latency. The default value is 4096 bytes
    to ensure reasonable latency and bandwidth by ensuring medium
    size GASNet active messages are used on both Infiniband and
    Cray GASNet conduits.
 * `-hl:filter` - This flag is more subtle and we only encourage
    users to make use of it after gaining some understanding of
    how the Legion runtime operates. In some application, there are
    many live operations that are non-interfering in different
    ways simultaneously. Since most non-interference tests end
    up failing, there is significant amounts of runtime analysis
    that is not useful. To help reduce this overhead, users can
    request that the list of users of physical instances be
    trimmed to some maximum size, possible in a way that reduces
    the precision of runtime analysis but <b>not</b> in a way
    that is unsound. By default this setting is disabled with
    the value 0. Reasonable values are usually in the range of
    128 to 4096.
